Project title: Reddit filter

Problem Statement: 
Reddit is a mass media tool with all kinds of information 
accessible to people of all ages. Although Reddit tends to be humorous and 
informative on some occasions, it does tend to have users who upload negative
material to the site or material that parents would like to filter out for their
children or users would like to filter out for themselves. The problem is how can
the content on Reddit be mitigated by a scale of preference, how can users on Reddit
filter out the content they don't want to see or hear and still enjoy what Reddit
has to offer. 

How do you solve the problem: 
We intend to solve the problem by using Google's machine
learning API to classify content on each Reddit page. The machine learning model would
be trained to spot purely negative content to totally harmless content. The model 
also learns the difference between both ends in a continuous form, meaning the model is
aware of content that is slightly harmful and very harmful; it is not a discrete 
classification process, but a scale between the harmful and harmless end. 
The machine learning model becomes the backend to the Google chrome extension we intend
to create, the extension gives the user the ability to mitigate the amount of negativity
that is displayed on a Reddit page.
