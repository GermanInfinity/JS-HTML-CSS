Purpose of GIT REPO: 
To showcase work I have developed and material I have learned
and implemented from Tufts COMP20 Web programming class, Spring 2019.

Favorite Lab: 
My favorite lab was the responsive lab, because I really like the images. 
But also, because I enjoyed learning that websites rendered on mobile phones
are made better with an easy fix/addition of a css responsive design.

Favorite assignment: 
My favorite assignment was the first half of the liftknockof homework. 
Although I enjoy backend and server side development, I know this because
of the material I work on for the semester project, I never felt like I had
a firm grasp of the second half of this assignment which was building the server
More so, this led to security, in which I almost found myself losing feet.
I guess it's because it was nearing the end of the semester, and I was really
proud of the work I was doing on my semester project that I didn't worry so 
much about security. 

How much have I grown?
I can use API's, that say's a lot! 

Most important thing learned? 
The most important thing I learned was how to use an API. It helped me get a
job! I used google drives api to access a folder online and download an image
to process. It was really awesome, and I could not have done it without 
comp20. Evidence- I use another Google API in our semester group project. 

What topic would I like to delve deep into?
Naturally, I'd say machine learning cause that's where my focus is; but
bringing it together; I'd actually like to learn some stuff about the cloud 
and maybe even hosting machine learning pipelines online. Sounds like some cool 
stuff, that may even be a big part of the future!
