What was implemented correctly:
- Displaying info markers and distances between points on map
- Using info window correctly and also using the API correctly

When i had to return the shortest distance between drivers and passengers, I really thought about
how to implement that. I tried calling a function that’d return the distance, but it didn’t quite work. I 
then realized I could set a global variable that would update and I would always have access to it.
So, that was good
Another aspect of the homework I enjoyed or implemented correctly was working with the googleapi 
and figuring out how to set the display picture of the marker. 

Collaborators: 
I didn’t necessarily collaborate with anyone on this assignment, just a little bit of help and motivation
from some of the TA’s. i.e Kingsley and Michael!
I also made use of the Haversine function from stack overflow. 

Hours spent: I spent about 7 hours total on this assignment.
