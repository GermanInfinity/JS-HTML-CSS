Final Homework
Aspects of homework implemented correctly, or not: 
Searching and sifting through the databases of OWASP
to determine what security threats there are for a web application.
What did not work correctly, was the fact I was not able to physically
hack the system. But I was able to find places in the system that 
could be susceptible to threats. 

Collaborators: 
Brita Dawson - used her code to investigate security issues. 
Michael Robinson - as always being a good TA. 
Ming Chow - for help trying to also break my partners code. 

Hours spent: 3 hours.
